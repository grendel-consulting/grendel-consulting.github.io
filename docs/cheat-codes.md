# Cheat Codes

Cheat codes have been around for as long as video games have existed, although their form and function have evolved over time. The earliest cheat codes were actually built into the game code itself, as developers would include secret commands or combinations of actions that would activate hidden features or give players advantages.

One of the earliest examples of this was in the 1978 game Space Invaders, where entering a specific sequence of button presses on the arcade machine's control panel would cause the game to glitch and award the player extra lives.

As video games became more popular in the 1980s and 1990s, cheat codes became more widespread and sophisticated. Many games included built-in cheat codes that could be activated by entering specific button combinations or commands at certain points in the game. Some of the most famous examples of this include the "Konami Code," which first appeared in the 1986 game Gradius and became a widely recognized cheat code in many Konami games.

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, cheat codes became even more popular thanks to the rise of online gaming and the availability of cheat code websites and forums. Players could find and share codes for their favorite games, giving them access to all sorts of hidden features, infinite lives, or other advantages.

Today, cheat codes are still a part of many video games, although they are often more limited in scope and harder to find. Some games have built-in cheat menus or options that can be unlocked through gameplay or by completing certain objectives, while others require players to use third-party software or hacking tools to access cheats.
